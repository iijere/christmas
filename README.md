I have implemented a Python module to validate the compliance status of Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) policies before and after policy deployments. This solution can be integrated into our CI/CD pipeline via the MKS Platform Automation.

### Design Overview:

1. **Pre-deployment Phase:**
   - Captures the initial compliance state of all policies in a specified policy namespace.
   - Stores the state data in Amazon S3 for later comparison.

2. **Post-deployment Phase:**
   - Waits for a configurable period (wait_time) to allow for policy evaluation.
   - Captures the new compliance state.
   - Compares it with the pre-deployment state.
   - Generates a detailed compliance report.

3. **Reporting:**
   - Generates both an HTML report (stored in S3) and a console-friendly output in Ansible logs.
   - Displays key metrics, including:
     * Total number of policies and managed clusters.
     * Number of policy changes made during deployment.
     * Number of non-compliant policies and affected clusters.
     * Detailed compliance status changes.

The solution has been implemented and successfully tested, providing visibility into changes in policy compliance during deployments.

### Future Improvements:

1. **Enhanced Metrics:**
   - Track historical compliance trends.
   - Generate compliance success rate metrics.
   - Add metrics for policy deployment performance.

2. **Integration Enhancements:**
   - Integrate with notification systems (e.g., Slack, email).
   - Add webhook support for external systems.
   - Create a custom dashboard for historical reports.

3. **Advanced Features:**
   - Provide auto-remediation suggestions for common non-compliance issues.
   - Conduct policy impact analysis before deployment.
   - Group clusters by region/environment for improved reporting.

4. **Report Customization:**
   - Configure report templates.
   - Implement custom filtering and grouping options.
   - Allow export of reports in various formats (PDF, CSV).

### Technical Highlights:
- Implemented using Python with the Kubernetes client library.
- Integrated with Ansible for CI/CD pipeline compatibility.
- HTML reports contain detailed compliance data.
- S3 is used for report storage.
- Console-friendly output is provided in Ansible logs.

### Testing Notes:
- The solution has been tested in environments with over 700 managed clusters.
- It successfully captures compliance states pre- and post-deployment.
- It accommodates both 'enforce' and 'inform' policy modes.
- Violations are properly extracted and displayed in the messages.

This solution effectively meets the requirements for comparing policy compliance status before and after deployment, enabling confident policy releases without the need for manual testing.
